# Manipulados

Manipulados is a web application, for managing the compounded drugs making process at the portuguese pharmacies. It pretends to automate the process of registering and keeping the information.

### Features

-   budget
-   preparation
-   archive

### Tech

Manipulados uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

-   [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
-   [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
-   [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

And of course Manipulados itself is open source with a public repository
on GitHub.

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```
