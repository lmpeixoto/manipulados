### Tech

Manipulados uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework


And of course Manipulados itself is open source with a public repository
 on GitHub.
